<p>Hello World!I'm a 17 year old from the Bay Area that loves to design and build things whether it has to do with the tech world or interior designing. Outside of the classroom you will find me in the dance studio practicing routines or on the field working on my lacrosse skills. </p>

<p> Even though I play sports, I'm not really into running. To add to that, I don't care for snakes or spiders! I love animals but those two freak me out! I prefer cold weather to hot weather, but the perfect temperature for me is in between.    </p>
